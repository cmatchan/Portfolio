        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>I am currently a research assistant at
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/bioinspired/">
        Bioinspired Robotics and Design Lab</a> at UC San Diego. Our lab
        specializes in soft robotics that forgo rigid and electrical
        components in robotics. The benefit of soft robots lies in their
        material flexibility as a result of their soft, silicone-based
        material construction. Rigid robots can be dangerous to workers in
        a factory environment or patients in a healthcare environment, can
        damage delicate objects such as fruits or animals, or can be
        dangerous to operate in gaseous or aqueous environments due to
        their electrical components. In contrast, soft robots that are
        powered and controlled by pneumatics can be an excellent solution
        to these operating scenarios.</p>

        <p>My research focuses on the exploration of pneumatic circuit
        analogs of existing electrical circuit designs. Some projects of
        mine include designing pneumatic analogs of a potentiometer, a
        transistor, and an LED grid display. The pneumatic potentiometer
        project provides an inexpensive dynamic pressure control system
        for pneumatic actuators. The pneumatic transistor project
        demonstrates how the bi-stable soft valve design from previous
        research literature can be used to program the gait of a walking
        quadruped robot. The pneumatic LED grid display serves as a
        control system foundation for haptic shape displays that can be used
        to enhance virtual reality experiences.</p>
